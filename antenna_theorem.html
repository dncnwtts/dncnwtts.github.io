<h2>The Antenna Theorem</h2>

<p> 

This is a derivation of the semi-famous antenna theorem, which can be summarized by the two
equations
\[
\int_{4\pi}A_e\,d\Omega=\lambda^2\,\qquad \langle A_e\rangle=\frac{\lambda^2}{4\pi}.
\]
Here I follow the <a href=http://www.cv.nrao.edu/course/astr534/PDFnewfiles/AntennaTheory.pdf>NRAO
radio astronomy courses's notes</a>, which are a great resource for someone like me who knows a fair
amount of cosmology but little of how measurements are made.

The first concept is that of the <i>effective collecting area</i> $A_e$ of an antenna. The total
spectral energy, integrated over frequency, that a receiver collects will be the product of the
geometric area $A$ and the flux density $S$. A real antenna that collects spectral energy $P_\nu$
has an effective area,
\[
A_e\equiv\frac{P_\nu}{S_\text{matched}}
\]
where $S_\text{matched}$  is the flux density of a matched polarization, i.e. only the energy from
one direction of polarization. For an unpolarized source, this is just half of the flux density.
Therefore,
\[
P_\nu=A_eS_\text{matched}=A_e\frac S2=\int_{4\pi}A_e(\theta,\phi)\frac{B_\nu}{2}d\Omega
\]
where $S_\nu=B_\nu$ since we're taking the antenna to be in thermal equilibrium. I belive that in
this last equation, we had implicitly defined $A_e=\int_{4\pi}A_e(\theta,\phi)d\Omega$. It is known
that a warm resister creates spectral power
\[
P_\nu=\frac{h\nu}{\exp(h\nu/kT)-1}=kT\frac{h\nu/kT}{\exp(h\nu/kT)-1}\simeq kT
\]
for low frequencies (i.e. radio frequencies). The blackbody term, conversely, is given by
\[
B_\nu=\frac{2kT\nu^2}{c^2}\frac{h\nu/kT}{\exp(h\nu/kT)-1}\simeq\frac{2kT\nu^2}{c^2}
\]
Using this, we can find the integrated area,
\[
\int_{4\pi}A_e\,d\Omega=\frac{2P_\nu}{B_\nu}=kT\frac{c^2}{kT\nu^2}=\lambda^2
\]
which means that the average collecting area is given by
\[
\langle A_e\rangle=\frac{\int_{4\pi}A_e\,d\Omega}{\int_{4\pi}d\Omega}=\frac{\lambda^2}{4\pi}
\]
Note that this works only for lossless antennas, but it also shows that you want to use antennas to
work with long wavelengths to get good reception. Note that <i>any</i> antenna, no matter the size,
has the same average collecting area, at that wavelength.

Also note that time reversal basically lets us run things in reverse, i.e. you can look at a
receiver or an antenna and get the same equations; this lets us relate the gain $G(\theta,\phi)$
(the proportion of energy being thrown out of the antenna) to $A_e$;
\[
\langle A_e\rangle=\frac{\lambda^2}{4\pi},\qquad\langle G\rangle=1\Rightarrow
A_e(\theta,\phi)=\frac{\lambda^2G(\theta,\phi)}{4\pi}
\]
