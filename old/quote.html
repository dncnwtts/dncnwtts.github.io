<h3>On Inflation</h3>

What caused the initial perturbations of the Universe, i.e. $\Phi=2\Theta_0$?
Scott Dodelson, in Section 6.2 of his <a href="http://home.fnal.gov/~dodelson/book.html">
fantastic textbook</a>, has this to say;
<blockquote>
If this book were a novel or a biography, a better title for this section
might be
<i>Midlife Crisis</i>. The main character would have attended a good high school,
studied
hard, and gone on to a solid university. There he fell in love with an
exciting, but
sensible, woman; upon graduating, he set up some interviews, and got a good
job
downtown. He married his college girlfriend, and after several years in the
city, they
moved to the suburbs and had three kids. Our hero contributed to the community
and was recognized all over town as a solid citizen. He was moving up fast in
his
company and there was talk about a political position. Just when he was about
to declare his candidacy, he began to have doubts. "What have I been doing
with
my life? What is really important? Were all those years of study and work
simply
a 'track' ? Did I take this path just because everyone else was moving in the
same
direction? Where is the innovation and the signature that my life is mine?"
And
worse, he has a secret, an underlying feeling that everything he has built is
based
on a fallacy.
</blockquote>
I feel like we, as cosmologists, are generally pretty sure that inflation
happened, but this is a cute metaphor for why it matters.
