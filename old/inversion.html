<h2>How to not invert a covariance matrix</h2>
<p>
So <a
href="www.johndcook.com/blog/2010/01/19/dont-invert-that-matrix/comment-page-1/">John
Cook</a> wrote a blog post, suggesting that you shoudn't ever, ever invert a matrix, or
at least hardly ever, the example being $Ax=b$, and the "solution" being $x=A^{-1}b$,
since inverting $A$ gives us numerical issues, and it's really faster to just do a
matrix factorization, i.e. there are codes that just give you $x$ without needing to
invert anything.
</p>

<p>
I would expect that my case is a counterexample, where I have a covariance matrix and I
need to calculate $\chi^2=\mathbf x^TC^{-1}\mathbf x$.
After talking with David Larson, it seems the answer to that is "no, there is another
way." Now there are codes in most languages that will just give you the solution to an
$Ax=b$, given $A,b$. How does that apply for me? Well, let's do a Cholesky
decomposition, with $C=LL^T$. According to the numpy documentation, we have $Ax=LL^Tx=b$, which can be solved via
\[
Ly=b,\quad L^Tx=y.
\]
For my specific case then, we have $\mathbf x$, so we just want $z=C^{-1}\mathbf x$. So; we have
\[
y\equiv C^{-1}\mathbf x\Rightarrow \mathbf x=Cy
=LL^Ty
\]
In the same form as before, we can solve (using numerical linear algebra programs)
\[
Lz = \mathbf x,\quad L^Ty=z.
\]
</p>

<p>
Once we've gotten $y$, we just need to get $\chi^2=\mathbf x^Ty$, and bam!, we've gotten
the answer without inverting a matrix once. I think I have this figured out in my
likelihood code, using <code>scipy.linalg.solve_triangular</code> to solve for the
arrays $y$ and $z$ above. This seems to have reduced the amount of time my code runs,
nominally, since a Cholesky decomposition is pretty fast compared to a straight-up
matrix inversion.
