<h2>Colormaps</h2>

<p>
After a little bit of thought about how the default colormap, jet, kind of
sucks for most purposes, I used the <a
href="http://matplotlib.org/users/colormaps.html">Matplotlib guide</a> to
colormaps to check out ones specifically for "diverging values", i.e. positive
and negative values. I simulated a CMB map with power spectrum $1/\ell^2$, and
visualized it with each of the diverging colormaps.

<p>
Based solely on the luminance profiles, BrBG, coolwarm, RdBu, RdYlGn are all
the "best" in terms of having equal brightness for equally diverging values.
Aesthetically, I like RdYlBu, seismic, RdBu, and coolwarm the best. Also
everything with pink or purple looks pretty ugly.
</p>

<p>
Also a possible idea is custom colormaps using <a
href="http://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/generated/seaborn.diverging_palette.html#seaborn.diverging_palette">seaborn</a>,
where the center can be dark instead of bright. This doesn't generally look
good, and is probably hard on printing, but it could be worth thinking about
more.

<h2>Matplotlib</h2>

<p>
This is something sort of silly to be proud of, but I found a way to change the default fonts in matplotlib into LaTeX, which took a little bit of
rooting around. Turns out the default file (in my case) that deals with these things is found in
<code>home/dwatts/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/matplotlib/mpl-data//matplotlibrc</code>. Most of the matplotlibrc
file is commented out for some reason, and I ended up using <a href="http://matplotlib.org/users/usetex.html">this
website</a> to figure out what I was doing. The example matplotlibrc file seems to do the trick, except for the fact
that it doesn't have the backend set up. That's the main reason why I even used the default file at all (also so I
wouldn't have files randomly lying around).
</p>

<p>
I think the differences are pretty stark, and it definitely integrates with a document produced in LaTeX. I'll show
before and after here.

<p>

A little subtle, but makes a big difference for my occasionally obsessive mind.
Worth mentioning that I used the exact same code to make these two plots.
</p>

<p>
I also had a bit of trouble actually finding this file, the code that returned the matplotlibrc file is <code>matplotlib.matplotlib_fname()</code>.
</p>


<p>
Just for fun, I decided to see how to change the color scheme. I ended up taking a working <code>matplotlibrc</code> file and adding the links as suggested in <a
href="http://matplotlib.1069221.n5.nabble.com/Dark-or-inverted-color-scheme-td22387.html">this forum post</a>, which end up being;
<br>
<code>
<br>
lines.color: white
<br>
patch.edgecolor: white
<br>
<br>

text.color: white
<br>
<br>

axes.facecolor: black
<br>
axes.edgecolor: white
<br>
axes.labelcolor: white
<br>

<br>
xtick.color: white
<br>
ytick.color: white
<br>

<br>
grid.color: white
<br>
<br>

figure.facecolor: black
<br>
figure.edgecolor: black
<br>

<br>
savefig.facecolor: black
<br>
savefig.edgecolor: black
<br>
</code>
<br>
I made just one figure, but it's pretty striking. Might use this for presentations, or at least "figures in progress" for the paper I'm working on.

<h2>How to make PGF plots</h2>

<p>
So I realized recently that Computer Modern isn't the default font for journals, and in fact it will change several times before publication. For $\mathrm{\LaTeX}$
documents, the best option is to just use a pgf file. This is slightly complicated, but for matplotlib it can be very easy. All you need to do is ensure you have a
pgf backend available to you, which should be the case in modern distributions. (I actually couldn't get it working when I installed via Enthought, but Anaconda
worked really nicely for me.) Anyway, <a href="pgfplot.py">here is the file that I used to make a test plot.</a> Obviously you can change what specifically is
plotted, but once you have it you just take it to your document and type <code>input.pgf</code>, and your plot will be rendered in beautiful whatever-font-you-want.
</p>
<p>
Also, I took this code from a stackexchange post but don't recall which post it was. Sorry! If this ends up being a problem, I can find the real answer.
