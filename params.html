<h1>How $\boldsymbol{H_0}$ is determined</h1>

The main way the CMB determines cosmological parameters is by measuring
$\theta_*$, which is the angular scale of the BAO at the redshift of decoupling
$z_*$. Briefly,
\[
\theta_*=\frac{r_s(z_*)}{D_A(z_*)}.
\]
The way that this is determined essentially comes down to the ratio of the
baryon and cold dark matter density $\omega_b\equiv \Omega_bh^2$ and
$\omega_c\equiv \Omega_c h^2$, which are both highly degenerate with
$h=H_0/(100\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}})$.

Crucially, the expansion history comes into this, and can be determined however
loosely through this. The details of this are complicated, but we essentially
get a determination of the expansion rate at the time of decoupling $H_*$.
Recall that
\[
H(z)^2/H_0^2=\Omega_m(1+z)^3+\Omega_r(1+z)^4+\Omega_\Lambda+\Omega_k(1+z)^2.
\]
Clearly $H_0$ and $z$ are inversely correlated, and $H_0$ and the density of any
parameter are also inversely correlated.

One potential avenue for a $\mathrm{\Lambda CDM}$ extension is adding new
relativistic species, $N_\mathrm{eff}>3.046$. This allegedly would increase the
$H_0$ from the CMB. On its face, this would increase
$\Omega_r$ at high redshifts, lowering $H_0$. However, increasing $\Omega_r$
also decreases the redshift of matter-radiation equality
\[
1+z_\mathrm{eq}=\frac{\Omega_m}{\Omega_r}.
\]
This in turn will lower $z_*$. Clearly then, if from the CMB we determine some
$H_*\equiv H(z_*)$,  we would infer the quanity
\[
H_0=\frac{H_*}{\Omega_m(1+z_*)^3+\Omega_r(1+z_*)^4+\Omega_\Lambda+\Omega_k(1+z_*)^2}.
\]
With a fixed $H_*$, determined essentially from $\theta_*$, lowering $z_*$ would
increase $H_0$'s value.
