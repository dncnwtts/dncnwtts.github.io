Thoughts on being an American in Norway:

Hade a quite long conversation with my roommate last night, and her impression
of Americans, Black Lives Matter, etc. One thought she had was "How could
someone think someone is less than because of their skin color?" but then
proceeded to say things about the Somali population, essentially calling them
welfare abusers ("navvers" was the term, because NAV is the sick leave system in
Norway).

So it's interesting... I think they have a similar view that people who accept
systemic racism in the US, that "why would anybody be racist", to assume that
you only choose outword prejudice.
