<h1>Foreground strength calculation</h1>

In the CLASS sensitivity paper, we use the relation
\[
\alpha_\nu=\left(\frac{\nu_W}{\nu}\right)^\beta
\frac{\partial B_\nu/\partial T}{\partial B_{\nu_W}/\partial T}
\approx\left(\frac{\nu_W}{\nu}\right)^{\beta-2}
\]
This factor is clearly a conversion between the antenna temperature and the
thermodynamic temperature. From what I can tell, the conversion between
antenna temperature and thermodynamic temperature is given by
\[
g(\nu)=\frac{\partial T}{\partial T_A}=\frac{(e^x-1)^2}{x^2e^x}
\]
where $x=\nu/56.78\,\mathrm{GHz}$. I was able to derive this result from
writing $T_A=\frac{h\nu}K(e^x-1)^{-1}$ and taking the derivative with respect
to $T$, the thermodynamic temperature. In the sensitivity document, it seems
like the conversion factor is $\partial B_\nu/\partial T_A$, since
$B_\nu=2k\nu^2 T_A/c^2$, which gives the result
$\alpha_\nu\approx(\nu_W/\nu)^{\beta-2}$.

However, when I use the $g(\nu)$ treatment, which as far as I can tell doesn't
use any approximations, we get something different. To summarize the
derivation, (with tildes denoting antenna temperature, no tilde thermodynamic
temperature) we have
\begin{align*}
\tilde P((\nu)&=\tilde P(\nu_i)\left(\frac\nu{\nu_i}\right)^{\beta}
\\
P(\nu)&=g(\nu)\tilde P(\nu)
\\
\frac{P(\nu)}{g(\nu)}&=\frac{P(\nu_i)}{g(\nu_i)}\left(\frac{\nu}{\nu_i}
\right)^{\beta}
\\
\alpha_{\nu_i}(\nu)&=\frac{g(\nu)}{g(\nu_i)}\left(\frac{\nu}{\nu_i}\right)^\beta
=\left(\frac\nu{\nu_i}\right)^{\beta-2}
\left(\frac{e^x-1}{e^{x_i}-1}\right)^2e^{x_i-x}
\end{align*}
The only obvious time I see this $\alpha_\nu$ lining up with that in the
document is when $\nu\simeq\nu_i$, i.e. when the science band is very close to
the foreground band.

As for the actual calculations, to match up the $\alpha$'s in table 11 with
the ones using this formula, it looks like the results are only consistent
when each $\beta$ is replaced with $\beta-2$. For the CLASS Q-band, the two
methods (with $\beta=-3.0$) give
\[
\left(\frac{93}{38}\right)^{-3}=0.41,\qquad
\alpha_{\nu_S}(\nu_W)=0.082
\]
while the PIPER 270 GHz band gives (with $\beta=1.8$)
\[
\left(\frac{93}{270}\right)^{1.8}=0.15,\qquad
\alpha_{\nu_D}(\nu_W)=0.036
\]
