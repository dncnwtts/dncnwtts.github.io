<h2>Quantum</h2>

Something pretty obvious to those who have done some 3D algebra is that the cross product of a vector with itself is zero. Note that $(\mathbf A\times\mathbf B)_z=A_xB_y-A_yB_x$, and this is obviously
going to be zero if $A_xB_y=B_yA_x$. But this is actually the very heart of the commutation relation! So it turns out that
\[
\mathbf J\times\mathbf J=i\hbar\mathbf J
\]
just because of how the commutation relations work out, $[J_i,J_j]=i\hbar\varepsilon_{ijk}J_k$. I suppose this is obvious if you're familiar with using the Levi-Civita symbol to write cross products, with
\[
(\mathbf A\times\mathbf B)_k=\varepsilon_{ijk}A_iB_j
\]
In this form, it's pretty easy to show that if $i$ and $j$ aren't equal to each other and in the right order, we'd have $\varepsilon_{ijk}A_iB_j=[A_i,B_j]$. Anyway, if you know a little about vector algebra but not much about quantum
mechanics, or even a little of both, the above equation can look a little strange. But I suppose we always assume that we're in an Abelian groub in everyday life, right?
